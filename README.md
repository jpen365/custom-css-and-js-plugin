# Custom CSS and JS Plugin

A simple WP plugin for adding custom CSS and JS to a WP site. This plugin was created to demonstrate how to make a simple plugin for a tutorial posted at the WPMU DEV Blog. The sample plugin includes JS and CSS that makes HTML tables responsive to serve as a proof of concept (also, it's genuinely useful).
